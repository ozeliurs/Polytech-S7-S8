- With the digit dataset
  - Find the smallest dimension after PCA such that 95% of the variance is
  explained. (*numpy.cumsum and numpy.where*)
  - What is the proportion of explained variance in dimension 2 ?
  - Plot the digits after a PCA in 2D. Compare with the previous approach.
- Compare PCA and tSNE for the visualisation in 2D of the digit
dataset
  - compare the speed of transformation
  - compare the plots and play with the parameters
